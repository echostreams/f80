# 7-Segment PMOD

The following schematic shows a simple, two digit 7-Segment PMOD using only
one PMOD connector. This might be useful as other such PMODs (e.g.
from [Digilent](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/))
require two PMOD connectors. Building on a piece of perfboard is possible as
shown in the picture.
